* Softmax and log-sum-exp functions

* About

=softmax= and =logsumexp= evaluate the softmax function and the log-sum-exp
function of a vector x.  Softmax is the derivative of log-sum-exp.
$\mathrm{lse}(x) = \log \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{e}^{x_i}$.

Other program files are

- =test=: runs some simple tests of the functions.

* Usage

#+begin_src 
sm = softmax(x)
[sm,lse] = softmax(x)
lse = logsumexp(x)
[lse,sm] = logsumexp(x)
#+end_src

compute the softmax sm and the log-sum-exp lse at the vector x.
Both functions can compute both quantities because there is a lot of
overlap in the computations of the two functions.

* Requirements

The code was developed in MATLAB R2020b and works with versions
back to at least R2017a.
